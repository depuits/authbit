# AuthBit.
![](src/img/screenshot.png)
<center>Web-based OTP authenticator</center>
## Technologies
AuthBit is built with: 
 - [otpauth](https://github.com/hectorm/otpauth) library to generate OTP code online
 - [javascript-blowfish](https://github.com/javascript-blowfish) library to encrypt and decrypt data using Blowfish algorithms
 ## Security
 Your secret key will be encrypted. And all your data is stored locally. 
You can fork this repository and self-hosted AuthBit and use it even when you're offline.
I can't sure is's 100 % safe. So, **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
